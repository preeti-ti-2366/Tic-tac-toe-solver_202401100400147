Problem Statement
This project implements an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI. The AI uses the Minimax Algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring that it either wins or forces a draw.

🎯 Objective
Allow a human player (X) to play against an AI opponent (O).
The AI should always play optimally using the Minimax Algorithm.
Ensure that the game follows Tic-Tac-Toe rules and correctly detects wins/draws.
🛠 Approach
The AI determines the best possible move using the Minimax Algorithm, which works as follows:

Simulate all possible moves the AI can make.
For each move, predict the opponent’s best response.
Continue this process recursively until the game reaches a win, loss, or draw.
Assign a score to each outcome:
+1 if AI wins 🏆
-1 if AI loses ❌
0 if it's a draw 🤝
AI selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent’s chances.


🧠 Why Minimax?
Guarantees the best move for the AI.
Evaluates all possible game states to make an informed decision.
Ensures the AI never loses, making it a perfect player.
🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Add Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize the Minimax Algorithm.
✅ Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter or Pygame.
✅ Extend the game to support multiple difficulty levels.
